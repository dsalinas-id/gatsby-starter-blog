How Big a Change is the Move to GA4?
====================================

Pretty massive

Just for fun I decided to see if I could still use the tracking code from back when the tracking code still used "Urchin" in its name. It's located at:

!['urchin'](utm.png)

(the _userve = 2 is a flag to allow local logging of hits; so if this works it should send data both to google-analytics.com and my own web server logs at testga.com )

Sure enough it does:

!['hits'](hits.png)

And it shows up in realtime reporting as well:
